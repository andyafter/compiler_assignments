* Matrix Multiplication with GCC

** Abstract
Large matrix multiplications can be very handy considering 
the limitations of cache and the speed of the the RAM access.
This report is about conducting matrix multiplication with 
low level optimizations. Loop tiling and LLVM optimizations
are used in order to provide an acceptable result for a better
scheduling and work load reduction.
