**** Single running time 
Check out if the average output time in the code is stable.
And draw a diagram to show it. And try it with different 
size of data.

**** Time with different block size
Based on the above, design a program to calculate the average time of each block
size, and put it together to show the general trend.

**** Notice About Blocks
Block size cannot be something like 300, cause the result could be wrong

*** TODO Read Assembly Code
    DEADLINE: <2016-04-16 Sat>

*** TODO Check again, if the tiling is right
Write some tests maybe. You should spend time only when you finished others already.
